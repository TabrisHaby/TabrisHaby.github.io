1.The reason of this report

I am considering buying a condo recently since after working for years, I have saved some money. And I know, my money will defintely lose its value one day if I just save it in bank and do nothing. So I started to look at some condo information online, and to my surprise, Toronto HPI has increased dramatically recently, especially in last year(2017). Then I digged some data online and did this visualization report to show what is going on in Toronto House Market. For most of data I digged out couldn't be published online, all visualization here is based one open sourse data.

> Data From :

> House Price Index (https://housepriceindex.ca/)

> Historical Mortgage Rate (https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-rate-history-canada)

> All data are able to use and publish under acamedic and/or personal purpose only.
