This is a simple ATS(applicant tracking system) checking script for job
description keyword. Using package nltk with natural English stopwords inside
the package.

    Action Verb : Verbs regard as required action verb for job
    Noun Word : Nouns regard as main checker for HR
    Adj Word : Adj / Adv regard as descriptive word
    Noun Phrase : NN + NN + ... + NN or VB + NN

        Noun Phrase is always the key qualifications that is requred for HRs, and ATS uses these words
        as the keywords to pick up resume from resume pool. Like SEO, that means, the more these keywords
        resume has, the more probabilities to be selected by ATS.

When using functions, need to save job description as text file(TXT)
on local PCs or URLs.

The result is not so accurate, since :

    1. some words have different parts of speech, like team, is a noun and also a verb.
       So it will show up in both classification
    2. there are some diffculties to figure out if a word is adj or Past participle, like written.
       in sentence like "I have written...", it's a p.p., while in sentence like "we need written skills",
       it's adj.
    3. for some unknown reasons, nltk regards word like "manage","identify" as an adj instead of verb.
       I will do further study for this.

Environment :

      OS : Windows 10.0.16299 X64
      Language : Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]
      GUI : Spider 3.2.4 / IPython 6.1.0

As a demo here, I use news from cbc :

    https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-mulroney-toront-gun-violence-funding-1.4778899

and try to extract useful verbs, nouns, adj/adv and noun phrases
