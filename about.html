    <p><font size = '4'>About Myself</font></p>

    <p>My name is BoYu HA. I am working at Natural Healing Health Centre as Customer
      Data Analytics now.</p>


    <p>In 2014, I got certified as an Advanced SAS9 Programmer and for now, I have experience
      in using business analytics software SAS and SAS Enterprise Miner with skills like
      macro, query and analysis. </p>


    <p>I am proficient in Python and able to use different packages to finish processes like
      data cleaning, data extraction, visualization and predict the result with machine learning
      algorithms, like RandomForest, Regularized Regression, Gradient Boost Machine (GBM) and
      XGBoost. Also, I am learning deep learning knowledge in Python Tensorflow by online
      courses and resource now and already posted some of my work in this website. It is
      well-known as the key algorithm of applications like image recognition, automatic machine
      translation and artificial intelligence. </p>


    <p>I used statistical programming language R with RStudio for a long time. R is a language
      and environment designed for statistical computing and graphics and provides a wide
      variety of statistical and graphical techniques. This open-source language is always
      the good choice for data analysis and visualization for small-median data level.</p>


    <p>MySQL database is an important part for my daily job. In early 2016, I built the first
      version of Natural Healing Health Centre customer database, it was the first time I set up
      the whole database, from installing MySQL server, configuring parameters to import the
      original data from excel. It was a huge challenge for me at first since I never did
      something like this before. Although spent lots of time on troubleshooting the problem,
      I finally finish everything on time. In early 2018, I optimized the first version of this
      customer database, corrected some errors and typos, added some details table such as
      treatment duration and treatment frequency and generated the EER diagram for later work.</p>


    <p>Since the end of last year, I started to learning data visualization software Tableau.
      Although data visualization is available for some programming languages like seaborn in
      Python or ggplot2 in R, Tableau visual dashboard makes everything totally different. I
      participated the online courses from Tableau official website and Coursera and finished
      some real-time projects with commercial database. Now I already used this software in my
      own data analysis project.
      (https://tabrishaby.github.io/2018/03/11/Toronto-House-Price-and-Analysis/) </p>


    <p>In my spare time, I joined some basic-intermediate level machine learning and deep
      learning competitions in Kaggle and got pretty good results(top 5% - top 25%). This is
      not only the place I can get access to commercial database,  but also the place I learn
      new methods, algorithms and ideas. </p>
